## Features

- **Multi-Agent System:** CrewAI coordinates specialized agents for project management, architecture design, UX/UI, code generation, and documentation.
- **Machine Learning \& NLP:** Agents use ML and NLP to interpret user intent and optimize outcomes.
- **Reinforcement \& Transfer Learning:** Agents improve via feedback and adapt across domains (web, mobile, embedded).
- **Modern UI:** Real-time, context-aware recommendations and modular support for multiple domains.
- **Continuous Feedback:** User interactions refine agent suggestions and system performance over time.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VinKarwal/AutoDev-AIForAI.git
cd AutoDev-AIForAI
```

2. **Install Dependencies**


Open powershell (keep it running): 
```bash
ollama run codellama
```

Open another terminal:
```bash
conda create -n ai-for-ai python=3.11
conda activate ai-for-ai
pip install crewai langchain langchain-ollama
```

3. **Configure Environment**
    - Add necessary API keys and environment variables as described in `config.example.yaml`.
4. **Define Agents \& Tasks**
    - Specify agent roles and workflows in the configuration files.
5. **Run the Platform**

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Usage

- Launch the platform and interact via the user interface or command line.
- Assign projects and tasks to AI agents.
- Review real-time suggestions, documentation, and code outputs.
- Provide feedback to refine agent recommendations.

---

## Methodology

- **Multi-Agent Architecture:** Each agent specializes in a key development task (project management, architecture, UX/UI, code generation, documentation).
- **Learning Techniques:** Incorporates reinforcement learning, transfer learning, and semi-supervised learning for adaptability and efficiency.
- **User-Centric Design:** Offers a modern interface with context-aware, modular support for various domains.
- **Continuous Improvement:** Feedback loops ensure the system adapts to user needs and project requirements.

---

## Preliminary Results

- **Project Management Agent:** Breaks down requirements into structured tasks and milestones.
- **Architecture Design Agent:** Generates scalable, modular system designs.
- **UX Design Agent:** Produces intuitive wireframes and layout suggestions.
- **Code Generative Agent:** Outputs clean, functional code across multiple frameworks.
- **Documentation Agent:** Creates comprehensive, project-specific documentation.
